Calculator Use Cases:
-add x numbers
-subtract x numbers
-multiply x numbers
-divide x numbers
-any combination of the above

Calculator UI
-Probably use JFace
-Can try for standard calculator UI
-could take in the input as a string, then convert to numbers and functions


Structure:
-My current thought is to start with a Calculator Object. This class will contain the math functions
-Then have a UI class in the same package. 
-I think there should only be one package, as I don't foresee there being many required classes.
